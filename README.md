# springboot-email-thymeleaf-template-sample
In this repository we demonstrate how to send a mail with attachment using spring boot email template example, 
it uses Spring boot, Thymeleaf and HTML, gmail SMTP. we have used Gmail SMTP settings to send an email using this demo application.

## What is Thymeleaf
> Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments. HTML templates written in Thymeleaf still look and work like HTML.

## Thymeleaf HTML email template

Using Thymeleaf for processing our email templates would allow us to use some interesting features:

1. Expressions in Spring EL.
2. Flow control: iterations, conditionals, etc.
3. Utility functions: date/number formatting, dealing with lists, arrays…
4. Easy i18n, integrated with our application’s Spring internationalization infrastructure.
5. Natural templating: our email templates can be static prototypes, written by UI designers.

Also, given the fact that Thymeleaf has no required dependencies on the servlet API, there would be no need at all to create or send email from a web application. In this example we are going create very simple HTML template.
